	abstract = {This article uses propensity score methods to estimate the treatment impact of the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration, a labor training program, on postintervention earnings. We use data from Lalonde's evaluation of nonexperimental methods that combine the treated units from a randomized evaluation of the NSW with nonexperimental comparison units drawn from survey datasets. We apply propensity score methods to this composite dataset and demonstrate that, relative to the estimators that Lalonde evaluates, propensity score estimates of the treatment impact are much closer to the experimental benchmark estimate. Propensity score methods assume that the variables associated with assignment to treatment are observed (referred to as ignorable treatment assignment, or selection on observables). Even under this assumption, it is difficult to control for differences between the treatment and comparison groups when they are dissimilar and when there are many preintervention variables. The estimated propensity score (the probability of assignment to treatment, conditional on preintervention variables) summarizes the preintervention variables. This offers a diagnostic on the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups, because one has only to compare the estimated propensity score across the two groups. We discuss several methods (such as stratification and matching) that use the propensity score to estimate the treatment impact. When the range of estimated propensity scores of the treatment and comparison groups overlap, these methods can estimate the treatment impact for the treatment group. A sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates are not sensitive to the specification of the estimated propensity score, but are sensitive to the assumption of selection on observables. We conclude that when the treatment and comparison groups overlap, and when the variables determining assignment to treatment are observed, these methods provide a means to estimate the treatment impact. Even though propensity score methods are not always applicable, they offer a diagnostic on the quality of nonexperimental comparison groups in terms of observable preintervention variables.},

The initial discovery led to revisions of the original data by the authors and retraction of the numerical results in their article. Analysis of their revised data, however, reveals new systematic patterns of implementation errors. Indeed, treatment assignments of the revised data appear to be even less randomized than before their corrections. To adjust for these problems, I employ a more appropriate statistical method and demonstrate that telephone canvassing increases turnout by five percentage points.

	abstract = {This paper proposes entropy balancing, a data preprocessing method to achieve covariate balance in observational studies with binary treatments. Entropy balancing relies on a maximum entropy reweighting scheme that calibrates unit weights so that the reweighted treatment and control group satisfy a potentially large set of prespecified balance conditions that incorporate information about known sample moments. Entropy balancing thereby exactly adjusts inequalities in representation with respect to the first, second, and possibly higher moments of the covariate distributions. These balance improvements can reduce model dependence for the subsequent estimation of treatment effects. The method assures that balance improves on all covariate moments included in the reweighting. It also obviates the need for continual balance checking and iterative searching over propensity score models that may stochastically balance the covariate moments. We demonstrate the use of entropy balancing with Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications.},

	abstract = {Summary.  An instrument or instrumental variable manipulates a treatment and affects the outcome only indirectly through its manipulation of the treatment. For instance, encouragement to exercise might increase cardiovascular fitness, but only indirectly to the extent that it increases exercise. If instrument levels are randomly assigned to individuals, then the instrument may permit consistent estimation of the effects caused by the treatment, even though the treatment assignment itself is far from random. For instance, one can conduct a randomized experiment assigning some subjects to ‘encouragement to exercise’ and others to ‘no encouragement’ but, for reasons of habit or taste, some subjects will not exercise when encouraged and others will exercise without encouragement; none-the-less, such an instrument aids in estimating the effect of exercise. Instruments that are weak, i.e. instruments that have only a slight effect on the treatment, present inferential problems. We evaluate a recent proposal for permutation inference with an instrumental variable in four ways: using Angrist and Krueger's data on the effects of education on earnings using quarter of birth as an instrument, following Bound, Jaeger and Baker in using simulated independent observations in place of the instrument in Angrist and Krueger's data, using entirely simulated data in which correct answers are known and finally using statistical theory to show that only permutation inferences maintain correct coverage rates. The permutation inferences perform well in both easy and hard cases, with weak instruments, as well as with long-tailed responses.},

	abstract = {In some investigations, comparison of the means of a variate y in two study groups may be biased because y is related to a variable x whose distribution differs in the two groups. A frequently used device for trying to remove this bias is adjustment by subclassification. The range of x is divided into c subclasses. Weighted means of the subclass means of y are compared, using the same weights for each study group. The effectiveness of this procedure in removing bias depends on several factors, but for monotonic relations between y and x, an analytical approach suggests that for c = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 the percentages of bias removed are roughly 64\%, 79\%, 86\%, 90\%, and 92\%, respectively. These figures should also serve as a guide when x is an ordered classification (e.g. none, slight, moderate, severe) that can be regarded as a grouping of an underlying continuous variable. The extent to which adjustment reduces the sampling error of the estimated difference between the y means is also examined. An interesting side result is that for x normal, the percentage reduction in the bias of \${\textbackslash}bar x\_2\$-\${\textbackslash}bar x\_1\$ due to adjustment equals the percentage reduction in its variance. Under a simple mathematical model, errors of measurement in x reduce the amount of bias removed to a fraction 1/(1 + h) of its value, where h is the ratio of the variance of the errors of measurement to the variance of the correct measurements. Since ordered classifications are often used because x is difficult to measure, h may be substantial in such cases, though more information is needed on the values of h that are typical in practice.},

The absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the fact that standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to matching estimators with a fixed number of matches because such estimators are highly nonsmooth functionals of the data. In this article we develop new methods for analyzing the large sample properties of matching estimators and establish a number of new results. We focus on matching with replacement with a fixed number of matches. First, we show that matching estimators are not N1/2-consistent in general and describe conditions under which matching estimators do attain N1/2-consistency. Second, we show that even in settings where matching estimators are N1/2-consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Third, we provide a consistent estimator for the large sample variance that does not require consistent nonparametric estimation of unknown functions.

	abstract = {Exchangeability of observations is a key condition for applying permutation tests. We characterize the linear transformations which preserve exchangeability, distinguishing second-moment exchangeability and global exchangeability; we also examine non-linear transformations. When exchangeability does not hold one may try to find a transformation which achieves approximate exchangeability; then an approximate permutation test can be done. More specifically, consider a statistic T = φ( Y ); it may be possible to find V such that [Ytilde] = V ( Y ) is exchangeable and to write T = φ¯([Ytilde]). In other cases we may be content that [Ytilde] has an exchangeable variance matrix, which we denote second-moment exchangeability. When seeking transformations towards exchangeability we show the privileged role of residuals. We show that exact permutation tests can be constructed for the normal linear model. Finally we suggest approximate permutation tests based on second-moment exchangeability. In the case of an intraclass correlation model, the transformation is simple to implement. We also give permutational moments of linear and quadratic forms and show how this can be used through Cornish-Fisher expansions.},

	abstract = {Applied researchers are increasingly interested in whether and how treatment effects vary in randomized evaluations, especially variation that is not explained by observed covariates. We propose a model-free approach for testing for the presence of such unexplained variation. To use this randomization-based approach, we must address the fact that the average treatment effect, which is generally the object of interest in randomized experiments, actually acts as a nuisance parameter in this setting. We explore potential solutions and advocate for a method that guarantees valid tests in finite samples despite this nuisance. We also show how this method readily extends to testing for heterogeneity beyond a given model, which can be useful for assessing the sufficiency of a given scientific theory. We finally apply our method to the National Head Start impact study, which is a large-scale randomized evaluation of a Federal preschool programme, finding that there is indeed significant unexplained treatment effect variation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01132},
	abstract = {In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is the presentation of a general formula for the asymptotic variance of a semiparametric estimator. A particularly important feature of this formula is a way of accounting for the presence of nonparametric estimates of nuisance functions. The general form of an adjustment factor for nonparametric estimates is derived and analyzed. The usefulness of the formula is illustrated by deriving propositions on invariance of the limiting distribution with respect to the nonparametric estimator, conditions for nonparametric estimation to have no effect on the asymptotic distribution, and the form of a correction term for the presence of nonparametric projection and density estimators. Examples discussed are quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of index models, panel probit with semiparametric individual effects, average derivatives, and inverse density weighted least squares. The paper also develops a set of regularity conditions for the validity of the asymptotic variance formula. Primitive regularity conditions are derived for {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}{\textbackslash}text\{-consistency\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} and asymptotic normality for functions of series estimators of projections. Specific examples are polynomial estimators of average derivative and semiparametric panel probit models.},

	abstract = {Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to reduce the confounding that can occur in observational studies examining the effects of treatments or interventions on outcomes. We used Monte Carlo simulations to examine the following algorithms for forming matched pairs of treated and untreated subjects: optimal matching, greedy nearest neighbor matching without replacement, and greedy nearest neighbor matching without replacement within specified caliper widths. For each of the latter two algorithms, we examined four different sub-algorithms defined by the order in which treated subjects were selected for matching to an untreated subject: lowest to highest propensity score, highest to lowest propensity score, best match first, and random order. We also examined matching with replacement. We found that (i) nearest neighbor matching induced the same balance in baseline covariates as did optimal matching; (ii) when at least some of the covariates were continuous, caliper matching tended to induce balance on baseline covariates that was at least as good as the other algorithms; (iii) caliper matching tended to result in estimates of treatment effect with less bias compared with optimal and nearest neighbor matching; (iv) optimal and nearest neighbor matching resulted in estimates of treatment effect with negligibly less variability than did caliper matching; (v) caliper matching had amongst the best performance when assessed using mean squared error; (vi) the order in which treated subjects were selected for matching had at most a modest effect on estimation; and (vii) matching with replacement did not have superior performance compared with caliper matching without replacement. © 2013 The Authors.
